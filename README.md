## Memory Card Game - React Project

## Overview

This project is a React-based memory card game where users click on cards to earn points. The objective is to click on each card only once. If a card is clicked twice, the score resets. The game features a dynamic scoreboard that tracks the current and best scores, and the cards are shuffled randomly on each click.

## Features

Scoreboard: Displays the current score and the best score achieved.

Card Shuffle Mechanism: Cards are rearranged randomly after each click.

API Integration: Fetches images and information from an external API (Pokemon API used for this project).

React State Management: Utilizes React state and hooks to handle game logic and UI updates.

## Technologies Used

React: Component-based UI development.

JavaScript (ES6+): Logic handling and state management.

CSS: Styling for layout and animations.

Pokemon API: Provides images and data for the game cards.
